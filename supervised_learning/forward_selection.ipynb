    "In this activity, you will implement forward selection, a feature selection technique in which you start with no features and progressively add the most significant ones. Forward selection helps to build a more efficient ML model by identifying the most relevant features. The goal of this activity is to guide you through the steps required to apply forward selection to a dataset and refine your model by including only the most impactful features."
